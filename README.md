# Projects
I'm an young, independent researcher tackling frontier(and future) fields, such as nuclear fusion, antimatter and strategy based on first principles.

My goal is to frame new problems, fill gaps and push the field, whilst presenting the full logic behind every solution and making it open-source.

Any contributions will get reviewed, hovewer, feel free to pose questions and challenge the work to improve it further.
